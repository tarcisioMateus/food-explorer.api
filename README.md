# food-explorer.api

the back-end that feeds the front-end of a restaurant application, where customers can enter to place an order and the admin can receive the orders and edit the dishes as needed.

uses knex and sqlite3 to build the database and express to make http connections; also uses cookies and jwt to authenticate users.

As it is an API created to be used together with the client, I won't go into much detail about how it should be used here, other than how to initialize it.
## Run

to install all dependencies and start the application.
```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```

the other information on how the back-end works and is integrated with the front-end is in the README. file of the client.
